This page details my research interests and publications. If you have inquiries about my work or would like to collaborate feel free to [contact me](/contact/).

## Research Interests

I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student in the Computing for Social Good Lab at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. Juan E. Gilbert. I am also an alumnus of the University of Central Florida and a recipient of the GenNEXT, McKnight, and GEM Fellowships.  

Currently, I work as an AI Engineering intern at Aptima Inc., where I evaluate AI systems. My research interests include **artificial intelligence, games and simulations, culturally relevant computing, and promoting technical literacy in underserved communities**.  

I am passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact. Mentorship, community service, and supporting up-and-coming youth are central to my work, and I view my Ph.D. studies as a springboard for a meaningful career dedicated to impact and service.
