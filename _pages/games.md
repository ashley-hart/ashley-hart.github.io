I like to create games and other interactive media from time to time. You can find those here.

You can also find me on [itch.io](https://ashley-hart.itch.io/umbral)!


I design and develop indie games as part of my creative practice. My work includes game jam projects and experimental prototypes that explore procedural generation, storytelling, and player experience.
