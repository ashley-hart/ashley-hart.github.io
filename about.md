    I am a Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Florida studying under the advisement of Dr. Juan Gilbert. 
    I am also a McKnight Fellow and a GEM Doctoral Fellow. 
    My research interests pertain to artificial intelligence, explainability, and the effects that AI applications have on end-users, primarily youth and young adults.

    I previously attended the University of Central Florida where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science.
    During my time as an undergraduate, I was a Ronald E. McNair and NACME fellow.
    I participated in hackathons and won awards at KnightHacks and DeltaHacks with my teammates.
    I met wonderful people and engaged in mentorship and professional development opportunities.
    I conducted summer research in Summer 2020 with Dr. Matthew Dwyer through the Leadership Alliance.
    We examined Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems and optimization strategies employed by satisfiability (SAT) solvers developed by others and the one that I built over the course of the summer.
    In Summer 2021, I researched adversarial channels for quantum communication at Rutgers University with Dr. Anand Sarwate.
    This experience taught me how to tackle complicated topics effectively.
    I produced a poster which I presented at the RISE@Rutgers Symposium and other research conferences.
    
    In Summer 2022, I interned at Raytheon Technologies and got to experience firsthand how software developers build tools to enact positive and lasting change in our society.
    This opportunity allowed me to grow as an individual and as a professional. 
    
    My mission is to make meaningful contributions to my area of study while working to get into positions where I can help and uplift others.
    I will be cataloguing my journey on my blog, and I am open to professional inquiries about my work.
    My contact information can be found below. 
   
    Thanks, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
