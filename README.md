# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).  
The site serves as a hub for my research, blog posts, and creative projects, including game development.
